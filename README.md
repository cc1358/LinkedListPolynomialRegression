Overview

The Polynomial Data Science Toolkit is a sophisticated Python implementation that leverages doubly linked lists to represent and manipulate sparse polynomials for advanced data science applications. This single-file repository provides a comprehensive framework for polynomial operations, regression, feature engineering, and visualization, with a focus on memory-efficient handling of sparse, high-degree polynomials. It is designed for data scientists, researchers, and engineers seeking to model complex relationships in datasets, such as time-series forecasting, curve fitting, or statistical analysis.

Key highlights include:





Doubly Linked Lists: Efficiently store and manipulate sparse polynomials with O(n) insertion/deletion, ideal for memory-constrained environments.



Polynomial Regression: Fits data with customizable degrees and L1/L2 regularization, optimized for sparse polynomial representations.



Feature Engineering: Generates polynomial and interaction features for machine learning pipelines.



Visualization: Produces insightful plots of polynomial functions, regression fits, and training loss curves using Matplotlib.
